        Underperl is the result of in-depth exchanges within the group on what
        makes a useful software and discussions on what types of algorithms we
        find interesting and want to implement in our own version.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that brought us all together was our common interest in the
        THLR courses we took last semester. We therefore explored the idea of
        ​​creating a project related to this subject and therefore logically
        something that uses regular expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second point of agreement was our appreciation of the Abacus project
        carried out as a programming Practical in the second semester.
        Specifically, being able to build something from sratch without relying
        on preconceived modules had pleased us all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, from these two observations, the project now seemed obvious, a
        regular expression interpreter that takes user input. From this input,
        we must retrieve the tokens forming the regular expression (letters or
        concatenation symbol or other ...) and then pass them through the
        "pipeline" seen in THLR which, from a regular expression, forms an
        automaton that accepts it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This program will be made available to the user through an interface
        where they can use it to perform operations on text files such as
        searching, deleting, and replacing patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        One advantage of this project is that it will be composed of an
        algorithmic base and then independent programs from each other and
        therefore can be subject to improvements and additions of
        functionalities without questioning those pre-existing.
