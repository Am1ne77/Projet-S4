      <h1>What is regex ?</h1>
      <p>A regular expression, also known as a regex, is a pattern that is used to match and manipulate text strings. It is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.</p>
      <p>To create theses paterns there is three main operators : </p>
      <p>  - <b>the dot '.' </b>is used to concatenate two letters together, it is mostly used implicilty. For exemple a pattern that matches the word hat can be written "h.a.t" or "hat". </p>
      <p>  - <b>the plus '+'</b> matches any of the alternatives separated by the plus symbol. For example, the pattern "cat+dog" matches any string that contains either "cat" or "dog". </p>
      <p>  - <b>the Kleene star '*'</b> means zero or more occurrences of the previous letter. For example, the pattern "ba*" matches any string that starts with "b" followed by zero or more "a" characters, such as "b", "ba", "baa", and so on.</p>
      <p> Another very useful tool are <b>the brackets '[]'</b>.  It allows you to match any one character from the set of characters inside the brackets. You can use range inside the brackets, for exemple [a-z] match any lowercase letter.</p>
