      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>Born by pure luck, this group is composed of Djibril Traor√©, who is also the leader of this project, Amine Mike El Maalouf, and Attilio Levieils.</p>
      <p>This is the first time the three of us are going to work together, and we see this project as an opportunity to get to know each other a little more every day.</p>
      <p>The fact that we didn't know each other turned out to be an advantage when it came time to find an idea, as we were able to exchange without any preconceptions about the person and therefore focus exclusively on the quality of potential projects.</p>
      <p>Different ideas were put on the table, reflecting the richness of viewpoints of the minds composing this group.</p>
